## Overview

Development of a Wellness Weaver a health recommendation system using Python for back-end and HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT for design collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Disease Prediction:** Developed a system to predict diseases based on user-inputted symptoms using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- **Personalized Recommendations:**  Provided tailored recommendations for medication, diet, exercise routines, and preventive measures to improve overall well-being.
- **Voice Interaction:**  Integrated a voice recognition system for enhanced communication between the user and the system, making health management more accessible.
- **Drug Interaction Insights: ** Incorporated a feature to alert users about potential drug-drug interactions to ensure safe medication use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and system logic.
- **Flask**: For building the web application and server-side logic.
- **Sklearn:** For utilizing machine learning models like SVM, KNN, and Random Forest for disease prediction.
- **MySQL**: For storing user data, health history, and recommendations securely.

## Challenges and Learnings
A key challenge was ensuring the accuracy of predictions and providing relevant recommendations based on incomplete or ambiguous user inputs. Continuous model training and validation with up-to-date datasets helped overcome this challenge. Additionally, addressing privacy concerns and ensuring the security of sensitive medical data was crucial in the development process.
## Outcome
The health recommendation system now provides accurate disease predictions, medication suggestions, and lifestyle recommendations, improving the user's ability to manage their health proactively. The integration of machine learning and voice recognition has significantly enhanced user experience, and the system continues to evolve for broader application in preventive healthcare.
